# Gold-Price-Prediction-Model
 LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network that is particularly suited for handling time series data. It can capture long-term dependencies and has the ability to remember past information, making it ideal for modeling sequential data like stock prices.

The random forest classifier is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and stability of the model. It is particularly useful for handling high-dimensional datasets with complex interactions between variables.

To create a gold price prediction model using LSTM and random forest classifier, the following steps can be taken:

Data collection and preprocessing: Historical gold prices data from various sources can be collected and combined. The data can be preprocessed by removing outliers, filling in missing values, and scaling the data.

Feature selection and engineering: Relevant features that may influence gold prices can be selected, such as global economic indicators, geopolitical events, and supply and demand factors. Additional features can also be engineered, such as moving averages and technical indicators.

Train-test split: The dataset can be split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

LSTM model training: The LSTM model can be trained using the training set. The LSTM model will learn the patterns and dependencies in the time series data, making it capable of forecasting future gold prices.

Random forest classifier training: A random forest classifier can be trained using the same training set. The random forest classifier will learn the relationship between the features and the target variable, allowing it to make predictions based on the input data.

Model evaluation: The model's performance can be evaluated using the testing set. Metrics such as mean squared error and mean absolute error can be used to assess the model's accuracy.

Predictions: Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on new data.
